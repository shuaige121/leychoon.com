                    <p>Ley Choon Group Holdings Limited (<strong>"Ley Choon"</strong> or the <strong>"Group"</strong>)
                        is an established one-stop underground utilities infrastructure construction and road works
                        service provider. Since our inception as Ley Choon Constructions and Engineering Pte Ltd in
                        1990, we have grown our spectrum of services to encompass:</p>

                    <ul class="feature-list">
                        <li><strong>1)</strong> Underground utilities infrastructure construction and maintenance
                            services, which include water pipes, NEWater pipes, high-pressure gas pipes, high-voltage
                            power cables, fibre optic cables and sewer pipeline rehabilitation;</li>
                        <li><strong>2)</strong> Road and airfield pavement construction and maintenance services, which
                            include the supplying and laying of graded stones, cement treated base and milling and
                            laying of asphalt premix; and</li>
                        <li><strong>3)</strong> Construction materials supply services, which include production of
                            asphalt premix and recycled aggregates from construction and demolition waste and production
                            of ready mix concrete and cement bricks.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>As a one-stop underground utilities infrastructure construction service provider, our core
                        strengths reside with our technical expertise in underground utilities infrastructure and the
                        in-house supply of construction materials such as asphalt premix and recycled aggregates.</p>

                    <p>Ley Choon is one of the few asphalt plant operators in Singapore. Our asphalt plant is one of the
                        largest in Singapore with production capacity of up to <strong>400 tonnes per hour</strong>. The
                        built-in recycling feature and the offering of various asphalt premix formulations to meet
                        customer requirements provide us with a competitive advantage.</p>

                    <p>Our customers include Singapore government agencies such as <strong>Public Utilities Board
                            (PUB)</strong> and <strong>Land Transport Authority (LTA)</strong>, as well as reputable
                        companies such as <strong>Changi Airport Group</strong> and <strong>SP Group</strong>.</p>

                    <p>As a <strong>L6-registered contractor</strong> (the highest grade) with the Building and
                        Construction Authority (BCA), Ley Choon can tender for Singapore's public sector contracts of
                        unlimited value in the categories of cable/pipe-laying and road reinstatement, essential
                        construction materials and other basic construction materials. The Group is also an
                        <strong>A1-registered contractor</strong> in the category of civil engineering (CWO2).
                    </p>

                    <p>Leveraging on our expertise, the Group has been expanding overseas. The Group set up its first
                        plant in China, engaging in the construction waste recycling and the development, production and
                        sale of eco-green construction materials. Currently, the Group is undertaking a sewer pipeline
                        rehabilitation project funded by Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Sri Lanka, and has since
                        secured and completed a second project in FY2019.</p>

                    <p>Headquartered in Singapore with headcount of around <strong>1000</strong>, we build our
                        technology capabilities by investing in people, process and system optimization, such as the
                        application of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system and mobile CCTV monitoring system.</p>

                    <p>As a testament to our technological advantage and service quality, Ley Choon has been accredited
                        with <strong>IMS-ISO 9001</strong>, <strong>BS-OHSAS 18001</strong>, <strong>ISO 14001</strong>
                        and <strong>Green And Gracious Builder Award</strong>.</p>

                    <p>Ley Choon was listed on the Main Board of Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (SGX-ST)
                        in August 2012 via a reverse takeover of Ultro Technologies Limited and transferred to the
                        Catalist Board on 22 February 2017.</p>
